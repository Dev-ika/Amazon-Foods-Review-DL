Great work!
I was very disappointed by the product.  They are NOT long lasting as I was lead to believe.
"I really like the flavor of Jodhpur Lentils. It is soupy but if you let it sit for a few minutes after removing the pouch from the boiling water, it thickens nicely. I serve it over Casbah "
This is one of my favorite things to eat (I enjoy it several times a week)
"It's not bad, but I preferred the taste of Henry and Peggy's Stash of Tea"
not great!
